        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>It all started when I was 12 and got my first computer. Out of pure curiosity, I began exploring the world of programming.
            I was instantly fascinated by automation and the idea of creating my own tools and software.
            I started with Python, diving deep into logic and problem-solving.
            Four years later, I discovered Web Development — and I was hooked.
            The idea of building websites and applications that people around the world could use truly amazed me.
